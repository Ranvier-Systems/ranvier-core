## 1. Core Data Plane
### 1.1 SIMD Optimization for Radix Tree Lookups

- [ ] **Implement SIMD key search in Node16**
  _Justification:_ Node16 uses linear search over 16 keys. AVX2/SSE4.2 can compare all 16 keys in a single instruction, reducing lookup from O(16) to O(1) comparisons.
  _Location:_ `src/radix_tree.hpp:84-92`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add SIMD-accelerated prefix comparison**
  _Justification:_ Path compression stores multi-token prefixes. Using `_mm_cmpeq_epi32` for batch comparison can speed up prefix matching by 4-8x for long prefixes.
  _Location:_ `src/radix_tree.hpp:227-231` (insert), `548-555` (lookup)
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Evaluate memory-mapped tokenizer vocabulary**
  _Justification:_ Current tokenizer loads vocabulary into heap. Memory-mapping enables zero-copy access and reduces cold-start time for large vocabularies (100k+ tokens).
  _Location:_ `src/tokenizer_service.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Partial tokenization for routing decisions**
  _Justification:_ Tokenization accounts for ~10.6ms of ~10.62ms total routing decision time (99.9% of overhead). The ART lookup itself is <0.01ms. Currently the full prompt is tokenized, but routing only needs enough tokens to match against the prefix tree depth. Truncating the input to a byte budget before tokenizing could significantly reduce per-request tokenization cost.
  _Nuance:_ The system supports rewriting with tokenized output depending on the endpoint, so partial tokenization must not interfere with downstream token reuse. May require a two-phase approach: partial tokenization for routing, full tokenization deferred to the forwarding path only when needed.
  _Current mitigation:_ Tokenization is offloaded to a dedicated thread pool (not blocking the reactor), so the 10.6ms wall-clock time does not stall the event loop. Real overhead is thread pool queue contention + context switch, much less than 10ms.
  _Benchmark evidence:_ 30m run (b63c165, 2026-02-28) — CodeLlama-13b, 20 users, 8 GPUs. Routing decision P50: 10.62ms (tokenization: 10.61ms, ART: 0.01ms). Despite this overhead, P99 TTFT improved 78.2% (4500ms → 980ms) and cache hit rate improved from 12.5% to 73.9%.
  _Location:_ `src/tokenizer_service.hpp`, `src/tokenizer_service.cpp`, `src/http_controller.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Priority:_ P3 — Optimization. Not urgent given thread pool offloading and dominant TTFT improvement.

### 1.2 Zero-Copy SSE Parsing Refinements

- [ ] **Implement scatter-gather I/O for backend responses**
  _Justification:_ Currently SSE chunks are copied between buffers. Using Seastar's `scattered_message` can eliminate copies in the streaming path.
  _Location:_ `src/stream_parser.cpp`, `src/http_controller.cpp:400+`
  _Complexity:_ High

- [ ] **Add chunk coalescing for small SSE events**
  _Justification:_ Many small `data:` chunks cause syscall overhead. Coalescing into larger TCP segments improves throughput under high concurrency.
  _Location:_ `src/stream_parser.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 1.4 Memory Efficiency

- [ ] **Remove unnecessary atomics from ShardLoadMetrics**
  _Justification:_ `ShardLoadMetrics` uses `std::atomic<uint64_t>` for `_active_requests`, `_queued_requests`, and `_total_requests`, but since each shard has its own thread-local instance (`thread_local std::unique_ptr<ShardLoadMetrics>`), atomic operations are unnecessary overhead. With Seastar's shared-nothing model, regular `uint64_t` would suffice since there's no cross-thread access to the same instance.
  _Approach:_ Replace `std::atomic<uint64_t>` with `uint64_t` for all metrics counters. Update accessor methods to remove memory ordering parameters.
  _Location:_ `src/shard_load_metrics.hpp:132-134`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Batch CryptoOffloader statistics updates**
  _Justification:_ `CryptoOffloader` increments multiple atomic counters (`_total_ops`, `_inline_ops`, `_offloaded_ops`, etc.) on every crypto operation. While these are lightweight (relaxed memory order), they add overhead in high-throughput scenarios. More concerning is `_queue_depth` which uses `fetch_add`/`fetch_sub` for every offloaded operation.
  _Approach:_ Use per-operation local counters that batch into atomics periodically (e.g., every 100 ops or via timer). Consider non-atomic counters for same-shard-only statistics, exposing them via snapshot functions.
  _Location:_ `src/crypto_offloader.hpp:181-188`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Audit codebase for abseil container opportunities**
  _Justification:_ The codebase uses `std::unordered_map` and `std::vector` in several places where abseil alternatives (`absl::flat_hash_map`, `absl::InlinedVector`) would provide better performance. Abseil is already a dependency (used in RadixTree and TokenizationCache).
  _Candidates:_
  - `absl::flat_hash_map`: Replace `std::unordered_map` for better cache locality and ~20-40% faster lookups. Already done for TokenizationCache.
  - `absl::InlinedVector<T, N>`: Replace `std::vector<T>` for small, bounded collections to avoid heap allocation. Good for: token vectors in cache entries (N=64), small config lists, temporary buffers.
  - `absl::flat_hash_set`: Replace `std::unordered_set` where used.
  _Files to audit:_
  - `src/circuit_breaker.hpp` - `_circuits` map
  - `src/rate_limiter.hpp` - `_buckets` map
  - `src/connection_pool.hpp` - `_pools` map
  - `src/gossip_service.cpp` - various peer tracking maps
  - `src/router_service.cpp` - pending routes vectors
  _Note:_ While individual gains are small (microseconds), cumulative effect across hot paths may be measurable. Low complexity since abseil is already linked.
  _Location:_ Multiple files (see candidates above)
  _Complexity:_ Low

## 2. Distributed Reliability
### 2.1 Network Partition Handling

- [ ] **Push-based cache eviction notifications from GPU backends**
  _Justification:_ Ranvier infers backend KV cache state from routing history, creating a staleness window of minutes-to-hours. With 1M-token contexts, backends evict more aggressively, causing misrouted requests and wasted prefill. Push notifications cut staleness to ~25ms.
  _Design doc:_ [`docs/architecture/push-cache-eviction-notifications.md`](docs/architecture/push-cache-eviction-notifications.md)
  _Approach:_ HTTP callback endpoint (`POST /v1/cache/events`) + `X-Ranvier-Prefix-Hash` header echoing. Optional sidecar for engines that can't implement directly. New gossip packet type for cluster propagation.
  _Complexity:_ High (4 phases: MVP, cluster propagation, load events + sidecar, upstream engagement)

- [ ] **Add partition healing with route reconciliation**
  _Justification:_ After partition heals, nodes have divergent route tables. Need incremental sync protocol to merge without full state transfer.
  _Location:_ `src/gossip_service.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ High

- [ ] **Implement protocol version negotiation**
  _Justification:_ Rolling upgrades require backward compatibility. Gossip packets have `version` field but no negotiation or feature flags.
  _Location:_ `src/gossip_service.hpp:54`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 2.2 Dynamic Cluster Re-balancing

- [ ] **Add weighted route distribution across backends**
  _Justification:_ All routes treated equally. GPUs with more VRAM or faster interconnect should receive proportionally more prefixes.
  _Location:_ `src/router_service.cpp:189-246`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Implement route migration on backend scale-down**
  _Justification:_ When a backend is removed, its routes are orphaned. Proactive migration to healthy backends preserves cache locality.
  _Location:_ `src/router_service.cpp`, `src/gossip_service.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ High

- [ ] **Add hot-spot detection and load shedding**
  _Justification:_ Popular prefixes can overwhelm a single backend. Detect hot prefixes and replicate routes to multiple backends.
  _Location:_ `src/radix_tree.hpp`, `src/router_service.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ High

### 2.3 Gossip Protocol Reliability

- [ ] **Add anti-entropy protocol for periodic state sync**
  _Justification:_ Gossip only propagates new routes. Nodes that missed announcements have no catch-up mechanism. Periodic Merkle tree comparison ensures convergence.
  _Location:_ `src/gossip_service.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ High

---


---

## 3. Observability
### 3.1 Prometheus Metrics Enhancements

- [ ] **Add cluster health metrics**
  _Justification:_ Need visibility into gossip peer health, message rates, and sync lag.
  _Metrics:_ `ranvier_cluster_peers_alive`, `ranvier_gossip_lag_seconds`
  _Location:_ `src/gossip_service.cpp`, `src/metrics_service.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

### 3.3 Structured Logging Improvements

- [ ] **Add structured JSON logging option**
  _Justification:_ Plain text logs are difficult to parse. JSON logs enable integration with ELK/Splunk/Loki.
  _Location:_ `src/main.cpp`, `src/config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Add audit logging for admin operations**
  _Justification:_ No record of who registered/removed backends. Required for security compliance.
  _Events:_ `backend_registered`, `backend_removed`, `route_cleared`, `config_reloaded`
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Implement log sampling for high-volume events**
  _Justification:_ Debug logs at high QPS can overwhelm storage. Add configurable sampling rate.
  _Location:_ `src/logging.hpp`, `src/config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

---

## 4. Infrastructure & Security
### 4.1 Container Security

- [ ] **Add seccomp profile**
  _Justification:_ Restrict syscalls to those required by Seastar. Blocks exploitation of kernel vulnerabilities.
  _Location:_ Create `seccomp-profile.json`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 4.2 Transport Security

- [ ] **Add mTLS for backend connections**
  _Justification:_ Backend connections are unencrypted. Sensitive prompt data exposed on network.
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp`, `src/connection_pool.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Implement certificate rotation**
  _Justification:_ Static certificates require restart to rotate. Add file watcher for automatic reload.
  _Location:_ `src/main.cpp`, `src/config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 4.3 Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Add role-based access control (RBAC)**
  _Justification:_ Single admin key grants all permissions. Need separation between "read metrics" and "modify routes".
  _Roles:_ `admin`, `operator`, `viewer`
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Integrate external secrets management**
  _Justification:_ API keys stored in plaintext config. Support Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.
  _Location:_ `src/config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 4.4 Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

- [ ] **Implement per-API-key rate limiting**
  _Justification:_ Current rate limiting is per-IP only. Shared infrastructure (NAT) causes false positives.
  _Location:_ `src/rate_limiter.hpp`, `src/http_controller.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add connection limits per client**
  _Justification:_ Single client can exhaust connection pool. Add `max_connections_per_client` config.
  _Location:_ `src/connection_pool.hpp`, `src/config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low

---


---

## 5. Developer Experience
### 5.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] **Add fuzzing for gossip protocol parser**
  _Justification:_ Gossip deserialization handles untrusted input. Fuzzing detects buffer overflows and parsing bugs.

  _Tools:_ Dependabot, Trivy, or Snyk
  _Location:_ `.github/workflows/`
  _Complexity:_ Low

### 5.2 Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] **Add chaos testing for cluster scenarios**
  _Justification:_ Integration tests use clean network. Need to test packet loss, latency, and node failures.
  _Tools:_ Toxiproxy, tc (traffic control), or Chaos Mesh
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Increase unit test coverage to 80%+**
  _Justification:_ Current coverage unknown. Many edge cases untested.
  _Focus:_ Error paths in gossip, connection pool edge cases, config validation
  _Location:_ `tests/unit/`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add property-based testing for Radix Tree**
  _Justification:_ Current tests use fixed inputs. Property-based testing finds edge cases automatically.
  _Tool:_ RapidCheck (C++) or custom generators
  _Location:_ `tests/unit/radix_tree_test.cpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 5.3 Client SDKs & Documentation

- [ ] **Add runbook for common operational tasks**
  _Justification:_ No troubleshooting guide. Operators need documentation for: scaling, debugging, disaster recovery.
  _Location:_ `docs/runbook.md`
  _Complexity:_ Low

### 5.5 rvctl CLI Enhancements

The `rvctl` CLI tool (tools/rvctl) provides operator-friendly access to Ranvier's Admin API. Several endpoints and quality-of-life features are not yet exposed.

- [ ] **Refactor rvctl into package structure when >4000 lines**
  _Justification:_ Currently ~3300 lines as single file for easy deployment. If significant features are added, refactoring improves maintainability. Current section comments provide navigation.
  _Threshold:_ >4000 lines or >50 functions
  _Structure:_ `rvctl_lib/{cli.py, client.py, config.py, commands/, completions/}`
  _Location:_ `tools/rvctl`
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Priority:_ Low (defer until threshold reached)

- [ ] **Add unit tests for rvctl command functions**
  _Justification:_ CLI commands lack automated testing. Mock-based tests would catch regressions.
  _Location:_ `tests/unit/test_rvctl.py` (new)
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Priority:_ Low

- [ ] **Add `rvctl doctor` command for connectivity troubleshooting**
  _Justification:_ Operators need quick diagnosis of connection issues. Command would check: API reachability, auth validity, metrics endpoint, DNS resolution.
  _Usage:_ `rvctl doctor`
  _Location:_ `tools/rvctl`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ Low

### 5.6 Build System

- [ ] **Add Windows/macOS cross-compilation support**
  _Justification:_ Contributors on non-Linux need Docker for development. Native builds improve DX.
  _Note:_ Seastar is Linux-only; may require abstraction layer.
  _Location:_ `CMakeLists.txt`
  _Complexity:_ High

### 8.6 Action Items (Tracking)

- [ ] **[P3] Track config.hpp complexity - split when >2000 LOC**
  _Description:_ Monitor `config.hpp` (currently 1,510 LOC). When exceeding 2000 LOC, split into `config_schema.hpp` (type definitions) and `config_loader.cpp` (YAML parsing logic).
  _Rationale:_ Prevent config.hpp from becoming the next "sprawling module". Current growth trajectory suggests split needed within 2-3 feature additions.
  _Files:_ `src/config.hpp` → `src/config_schema.hpp` (new), `src/config_loader.cpp` (new)
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Trigger:_ >2000 LOC or >50 config fields

---


---

## 8. Benchmark Extensions
### 9.1 Production Prompt Traces

- [ ] **Define trace format (JSON/JSONL) for production prompt patterns**
  _Justification:_ Synthetic prompts don't capture real-world prompt distribution. Production traces enable realistic performance validation.
  _Deliverables:_
  - Define schema capturing prompt content, timestamps, user sessions
  - Support prefix annotation for shared system messages
  - Include metadata: model, temperature, max_tokens
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/data/traces/` (new), schema doc
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Modify locustfile_real.py to load and replay traces**
  _Justification:_ Current Locust test uses synthetic prompts with fixed distributions. Trace replay enables historical traffic patterns.
  _Approach:_ Add `TraceLoader` class, `--trace-file` parameter, timestamp-based replay scheduling
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add --trace-file option to bench.sh**
  _Justification:_ Simplify trace-based benchmarking via CLI.
  _Location:_ `scripts/bench.sh`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Create tool to anonymize/sanitize production logs into trace format**
  _Justification:_ Production logs contain sensitive data. Anonymization tool enables safe trace collection.
  _Approach:_ PII detection, content hashing, prefix preservation, configurable anonymization rules
  _Location:_ `scripts/anonymize_traces.py` (new)
  _Complexity:_ Medium

### 9.2 Cache Pressure Scenarios

- [ ] **Add --unique-prefixes N option to control prefix diversity**
  _Justification:_ Current benchmarks use 5 unique prefixes. Real deployments may have thousands. Need to test cache behavior at scale.
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`, `scripts/bench.sh`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Create "cache-pressure" prompt distribution**
  _Justification:_ Test behavior when unique prefixes exceed KV cache capacity. Validates eviction policies and degraded performance.
  _Approach:_ Generate N unique prefixes > vLLM block capacity, measure cache hit rate degradation curve
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add metrics to detect cache evictions (if vLLM exposes this)**
  _Justification:_ Understanding cache eviction rate helps tune cache size and routing policy.
  _Approach:_ Query vLLM `/metrics` for `vllm:cache_evictions_total` or similar, add to benchmark report. See also: [Push-based cache eviction notifications](docs/architecture/push-cache-eviction-notifications.md) for a design that goes beyond metrics to actively update Ranvier's routing state.
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Document expected behavior when cache overflows**
  _Justification:_ Operators need guidance on capacity planning and expected degradation.
  _Location:_ `docs/benchmarks/benchmark-guide-8xA100.md`
  _Complexity:_ Low

### 9.3 Larger Models

- [ ] **Update bench.sh to support tensor-parallel vLLM across multiple GPUs**
  _Justification:_ 70B+ models require tensor parallelism. Current bench.sh assumes single-GPU vLLM instances.
  _Approach:_ Add `--tensor-parallel N` flag, adjust vLLM launch command, GPU allocation logic
  _Location:_ `scripts/bench.sh`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add recommended configurations for 70B (8x A100) and 405B (multi-node)**
  _Justification:_ Users need reference configurations for large model deployments.
  _Deliverables:_ Sample configs, memory requirements, expected TTFT ranges
  _Location:_ `docs/benchmarks/benchmark-guide-8xA100.md`, `docs/benchmarks/benchmark-guide-405B.md` (new)
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Adjust expected TTFT thresholds based on model size**
  _Justification:_ Current thresholds calibrated for 8B-13B models. Larger models have different latency profiles.
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`, benchmark documentation
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Document memory requirements and GPU configurations**
  _Justification:_ Operators need clear guidance on hardware requirements per model size.
  _Location:_ `docs/deployment/hardware-requirements.md` (new)
  _Complexity:_ Low

### 9.4 Traffic Variability

- [ ] **Add traffic shapes to locustfile: ramp-up, spikes, diurnal patterns**
  _Justification:_ Real traffic is not steady-state. Bursty traffic tests cache warm-up and backpressure behavior.
  _Approach:_ Custom `LoadTestShape` classes for different patterns
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add --traffic-pattern option (steady, bursty, ramp, spike)**
  _Justification:_ CLI option to select traffic shape without code changes.
  _Location:_ `scripts/bench.sh`, `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Low

- [ ] **Measure cold-start impact when traffic spikes after idle periods**
  _Justification:_ Production systems experience traffic spikes after quiet periods. Cache is cold, need to measure warm-up time.
  _Approach:_ Add idle period before spike, track cache hit rate over time, report warm-up duration
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

- [ ] **Add metrics for cache warm-up time and hit rate over time**
  _Justification:_ Time-series cache metrics help operators understand warm-up behavior and set appropriate scaling policies.
  _Approach:_ Periodic cache hit rate sampling (every 10s), export as CSV alongside benchmark report
  _Location:_ `tests/integration/locustfile_real.py`
  _Complexity:_ Medium

## 10. HTTP Controller Review (2026-02-14)
### 15.5 Optimize Per-Chunk Flush in SSE Streaming Loop

- [ ] **Reduce flush frequency in `stream_backend_response()` via timer-based coalescing**
  _Justification:_ Every `bundle.in.read()` iteration triggers `write()` + `flush()` to the client. At typical LLM token rates (30-100 tok/s), each token arrives as a separate TCP segment, so this is effectively **one `sendmsg()` syscall per token** at steady state. Natural TCP batching only helps during bursts (multiple tokens arriving in one segment, which `StreamParser::push()` concatenates into a single `res.data`). At high concurrency (many concurrent streams), the per-token syscall overhead becomes measurable.

  **Previous attempt (2026-02-14, reverted in #280):** Flushed only on first write (TTFT) and `[DONE]`, relying on Seastar's 8KB `output_stream` buffer for intermediate events. This caused a **3.3x TTFT regression** because small SSE events (10-50 bytes each) never fill the 8KB buffer, stalling delivery for seconds until enough tokens accumulate. The regression was caught in production load testing and reverted.

  **Why "just skip flushes" fails:** Seastar's `output_stream` buffers 8KB by default. At 30 bytes/token, that's ~270 tokens (~9 seconds at 30 tok/s) before the buffer auto-flushes. SSE requires real-time delivery, so any approach that removes intermediate flushes without a bounded-latency fallback will break streaming.

  **Why "reactor tick coalescing" is not straightforward:** Seastar provides no primitive to check "is there more work pending in this reactor tick." `seastar::yield()` / `coroutine::maybe_yield()` are control-flow primitives, not introspection tools. You cannot peek at a future's readiness without consuming it, so "read-ahead to decide whether to flush" requires restructuring the entire loop.

  1. On entering the streaming loop, arm a periodic timer (~10ms interval, matching `lowres_clock` resolution).
  2. In the read loop, call `co_await client_out.write(res.data)` **without** `flush()`.
  3. The timer callback flushes whatever has accumulated: `(void)client_out.flush().handle_exception(...)` with a `seastar::gate` holder per Rule #5.
  4. Flush **immediately** on `res.done` (terminal event) and on stream errors/cleanup.
  5. Disarm the timer on loop exit (before `client_out.close()`).

  - The timer is **per-request** (created/destroyed with each `stream_backend_response()` call). This is fine — Seastar's `timer_set` is optimized for frequent create/cancel cycles. See existing patterns: `router_service.cpp:2058` (batch flush), `connection_pool.hpp:500` (reaper timer).
  - The timer callback is synchronous but `flush()` is async. Use the fire-and-forget pattern with gate guard: `(void)flush().finally([holder = std::move(holder)] {})`.
  - Must handle the race between timer-initiated flush and loop-initiated close. The gate ensures the flush completes before stream teardown.
  - Must handle `flush()` failure in the timer callback (client disconnect). Log and set a flag the main loop checks, or let the next `write()` catch the broken pipe.
  - **10ms worst-case latency** is acceptable for SSE token streaming (human-imperceptible). This coalesces 1-3 tokens per flush at typical rates, reducing syscalls by ~2-3x.

  - **TTFT test:** Measure time from first backend token to client receipt. Must be <15ms above baseline (currently ~1ms with per-read flush).
  - **Stall test:** Stream 100+ tokens at 30 tok/s, verify no token is delayed >20ms from backend receipt to client delivery.
  - **Burst test:** Send 10 tokens in <1ms from backend, verify they arrive at client in one batch (not 10 separate deliveries).
  - **Disconnect test:** Client disconnects mid-stream, verify timer is cleaned up and no use-after-free.
  - **Shutdown test:** Server drains while streams are active, verify gate prevents timer callback after stream teardown.

## 11. Hot-Path Performance Audit (2026-02-15)
### 20.7 Jump Consistent Hash May Reduce Cache Affinity vs Modular Hash

- [ ] **Evaluate whether jump consistent hash improves or degrades prefix cache locality**
  _Justification:_ The modular hash was replaced with jump consistent hash (`router_service.cpp:517-532`, called at line 1221) for better distribution uniformity when backends are added/removed. Jump consistent hash (Lamping & Veach, 2014) provides minimal disruption on topology changes but produces a different mapping than the previous modular hash. This means existing prefix→backend affinities were reshuffled. The benchmark regression may partly reflect degraded cache locality if the new hash distributes related prefixes differently across backends. This is speculative — the hash should be equally good for cache affinity in steady state — but worth validating.
  _What to change:_ Run a controlled A/B test comparing jump consistent hash vs the previous modular hash with identical workloads. If the steady-state cache hit rate and XLarge TTFT improvement are equivalent, the hash change is not a factor. If they differ, investigate whether the hash function's output distribution interacts poorly with the specific prefix patterns in the benchmark workload.
  _Location:_ `src/router_service.cpp:517-532` (implementation), `1221` (call site)
  _Complexity:_ Low (testing only)
  _Priority:_ P3 — Investigation; unlikely to be a factor but easy to rule out

### 20.8 Client-Token Path Redundant JSON Parse

- [ ] **Optimize `extract_prompt_token_ids()` to avoid full JSON parse**
  _Justification:_ When clients send pre-tokenized `prompt_token_ids`, the `extract_prompt_token_ids()` function parses the entire request body with RapidJSON (`doc.Parse(body.data(), body.size())`) just to extract the token array. For large requests with long system prompts, this is a full JSON parse of potentially tens of KB. The body is also parsed again downstream for forwarding/rewriting, making this parse redundant. Benchmark shows 0.35ms on the client-token path — 34x faster than server-side tokenization (12ms) but still the dominant cost on this path.
  _What to change:_ Options ranked by impact:
  (a) **Share the parse**: Parse the body once early in the request handler, pass the `rapidjson::Document` to both `extract_prompt_token_ids()` and downstream rewriting. Eliminates one full parse.
  (b) **Targeted extraction**: Use a SAX-style or on-demand parser to scan only for the `"prompt_token_ids"` key without parsing the entire document.
  (c) **SIMD token validation**: Replace the per-element bounds-checking loop (lines 731-755) with SIMD range checks — process 8-16 token IDs per instruction instead of one-by-one branch-heavy iteration.
  _Location:_ `src/request_rewriter.hpp:693-760` (implementation), `src/http_controller.cpp:801` (call site)
  _Complexity:_ Low (option a), Medium (options b/c)
  _Priority:_ P3 — Performance; 0.35ms is already fast but becomes significant at high concurrency with client-side tokenization

## 12. Request Lifecycle Performance Analysis (2026-02-20)
### 21.4 Avoid Heap Copy of Text for Tokenizer Cache Insertion

- [ ] **Eliminate redundant `std::string` copy captured in thread-pool tokenization continuation**
  _Justification:_ At line 325, the thread-pool tokenization path captures `text_copy = std::string(text)` in the `.then()` continuation lambda solely for cache insertion after tokenization completes. For a typical 4KB request body, this is a guaranteed heap allocation on every cache-miss tokenization dispatched to the thread pool. With 80–90% cache hit rates for system messages, this primarily affects user messages — but those are exactly the requests that take the full 5–13ms tokenization path, adding allocation pressure to an already-expensive operation.
  _What to change:_ (a) Examine the cache's `insert()` and `lookup()` signatures. If the cache uses hash-based lookup internally, compute the hash before dispatch (on the reactor, which already has the `string_view`) and pass only the hash + a pre-hashed key to the continuation. (b) If the cache API requires the full string for insertion (stores the key), consider having the thread pool worker do the cache insertion (it already has a local copy of the text for FFI per Rule #15). Ensure the thread pool worker's cache access is shard-safe. (c) Alternatively, return the text copy from the thread pool submission alongside the tokens, reusing the copy already made for FFI safety. The goal is to avoid a second copy in the continuation.
  _Location:_ `src/tokenizer_service.cpp:324-339`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ P2 — Performance; ~4KB heap allocation per cache-miss tokenization

### 21.5 Reduce `sstring` Reallocations in StreamParser

- [ ] **Pre-size the `_accum` buffer or switch to a chunk chain to reduce reallocations during streaming**
  _Justification:_ `StreamParser::push()` at line 57 appends each network chunk to `_accum` (a `seastar::sstring`). After exceeding the 15-byte SSO threshold (virtually every HTTP response), each append may trigger a reallocation + copy. A 100KB response in 50 chunks causes ~6–8 reallocations. The compaction at line 114 adds another `memmove` when read position exceeds 50% of the buffer, which is correct but doubles the copy work after each compaction cycle.
  _What to change:_ (a) During `parse_headers()` (line 133), if a `Content-Length` header is present, extract it and pre-size `_accum` to at least that value. This eliminates all reallocations for non-streaming (non-chunked) responses. (b) For chunked responses (no Content-Length), pre-size `_accum` to `StreamParserConfig::initial_output_reserve` (4096) on first push. (c) Note: `seastar::sstring` does not have `reserve()`. You may need to switch `_accum` to `std::string` (which does have `reserve()`), or use a `seastar::temporary_buffer<char>` chain that avoids copying entirely. (d) If switching to a chain, `compact_if_needed()` is replaced by dropping consumed chunks. Measure tradeoff: the chain avoids copies but complicates parsing when a token (e.g., `\r\n`) spans two chunks.
  _Location:_ `src/stream_parser.cpp:57`, `src/stream_parser.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Priority:_ P3 — Performance; 6–8 reallocations per response, each O(N) copy

### 21.8 Build Backend HTTP Headers Without Intermediate String Allocations

- [ ] **Replace `sstring` concatenation with `fmt::format` or pre-reserved append for HTTP header construction**
  _Justification:_ At lines 425–437, backend request headers are built via repeated `sstring` concatenation (`+` operator). Each `+` allocates a new `sstring`, copies left and right operands, and frees the old buffer. For 6 concatenation steps, that is 5 intermediate allocations. This runs on every proxied request.
  _What to change:_ (a) Replace with `fmt::format()` (Seastar includes fmt) for a single allocation. (b) Handle the conditional `traceparent` header (line 433–435) — either include it in the format with a conditional, or append it separately. (c) Append `"Connection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n"` (line 437) in the same operation. (d) Note: `fmt::format` returns `std::string` — verify that `bundle.out.write()` accepts it or convert to `sstring`. No behavior change — same header order, same values.
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp:425-437`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ P3 — Performance; 5 temporary sstring allocations per request

### 21.9 Skip JSON Parse When Client Provides Tokens and Prefix Boundary

- [ ] **Avoid `extract_text_with_boundary_info()` JSON parse when client provides both tokens and prefix boundary**
  _Justification:_ At line 833, `extract_text_with_boundary_info()` is called unconditionally for all non-client-token requests. At line 953–957, it is called again if `text_extraction` was not populated (client-tokens path) and prefix boundary detection is enabled. The client-tokens path can still trigger a ~500µs JSON parse for boundary detection even though the client already provided both `prompt_token_ids` and `prefix_token_count`.
  _What to change:_ (a) In the client-tokens path, if `_config.enable_prefix_boundary` is enabled, eagerly call `extract_text_with_boundary_info()` after determining `used_client_tokens=true`, and cache the result in `text_extraction`. (b) Alternatively, add a fast path: if the client provides both `prompt_token_ids` AND `prefix_token_count` (already checked at line 935), skip the JSON parse entirely — both pieces of information needed for routing are already available. (c) The goal: when client provides both fields, zero JSON parsing should occur.
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp:795-957`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ P3 — Performance; ~500µs JSON parse wasted when client provides all needed data

### 21.10 Capture `lowres_clock::now()` Once Per Streaming Loop Iteration

- [ ] **Cache `lowres_clock::now()` at the top of the streaming loop to eliminate duplicate call**
  _Justification:_ At lines 476 and 487 in `stream_backend_response()`, `lowres_clock::now()` is called twice within 10 lines. `lowres_clock` updates at ~100Hz (10ms resolution), so consecutive calls return the same value. This repeats for every chunk in the streaming loop (potentially hundreds of chunks per response).
  _What to change:_ Add `auto now = lowres_clock::now();` at the top of the while loop body (before line 476). Replace both `lowres_clock::now()` calls with `now`. No behavioral change.
  _Location:_ `src/http_controller.cpp:474-488`
  _Complexity:_ Trivial
  _Priority:_ P4 — Cleanup; negligible performance impact, improves code clarity

## 13. Code Modularity (Low Priority)
### 22.1 Extract BackendRegistry Interface from RouterService

- [ ] **Decouple HealthService and K8sDiscoveryService from RouterService**
  _Justification:_ HealthService and K8sDiscoveryService take `RouterService&` directly. They only use `get_all_backend_ids()`, `get_backend_address()`, and `set_backend_status()`. Extracting a `BackendRegistry` interface makes both services independently testable without constructing a full RouterService.
  _What to change:_ Define a `BackendRegistry` abstract class with the three methods above. Have RouterService implement it. Change HealthService and K8sDiscoveryService constructors to accept `BackendRegistry&`.
  _Location:_ `src/health_service.hpp`, `src/k8s_discovery_service.hpp`, `src/router_service.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ **P2** — Promoted; prerequisite for §15 Tier 2 (vLLM metrics ingestion)

### 22.2 Split config_schema.hpp into Infrastructure and Product Configs

- [x] **Separate generic infrastructure configs from routing-specific configs**
  _Justification:_ `config_schema.hpp` is 618 lines mixing infrastructure configs (ServerConfig, PoolConfig, HealthConfig, TlsConfig, AuthConfig, etc.) with Ranvier-specific configs (RoutingConfig, AssetsConfig). Splitting reduces cognitive load and makes infrastructure configs independently reusable.
  _What to change:_ Move infrastructure config structs to `config_infra.hpp`. Keep RoutingConfig and AssetsConfig in `config_schema.hpp`. RanvierConfig includes both headers.
  _Location:_ `src/config_schema.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ **P1** — Promoted; prerequisite for §15 Tier 1 (cost estimation + priority configs)

### 22.3 Split MetricsService into Helpers and Ranvier-Specific Counters

- [x] **Extract generic histogram/counter patterns from Ranvier-specific metrics**
  _Justification:_ `metrics_service.hpp` is 620 lines mixing reusable patterns (MetricHistogram class, bucket definitions, per-backend metrics map) with Ranvier-specific counters (tokenization, ART, prefix boundary). Splitting makes the generic patterns reusable and reduces file size.
  _What to change:_ Move MetricHistogram, bucket helpers, and the bounded per-backend metrics pattern to `metrics_helpers.hpp`. Keep Ranvier-specific counters in `metrics_service.hpp`.
  _Location:_ `src/metrics_service.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ **P1** — Promoted; prerequisite for §15 Tier 1 (per-priority metrics)

### 22.4 Template ShardedConfig on Config Type

- [ ] **Make ShardedConfig generic instead of hardcoded to RanvierConfig**
  _Justification:_ Trivial change (`ShardedConfig<T>` with backward-compatible alias `using ShardedConfig = BasicShardedConfig<RanvierConfig>`). Follows the existing pattern used by ConnectionPool, CircuitBreaker, and RateLimiter.
  _Location:_ `src/sharded_config.hpp`
  _Complexity:_ Trivial
  _Priority:_ P4 — Consistency with existing template patterns

## 14. Shard 0 Role Isolation Analysis (2026-03-06)
### 23.1 Exclude Shard 0 from P2C Candidate Pool

- [ ] **When cross-shard dispatch is implemented, exclude shard 0 from P2C candidate selection**
  _Justification:_ Shard 0 runs all control plane services (gossip consensus, K8s discovery, health probes). Under peak data plane load, these compete for reactor time, risking gossip heartbeat deadline misses and delayed health state propagation. Excluding shard 0 from P2C candidates protects control plane latency with minimal data plane capacity loss (~6% on 16-core).
  _Prerequisite:_ Backlog item 15.1 Option A (implement actual cross-shard dispatch via `smp::submit_to`). Until then, this change has no effect since P2C is advisory-only.
  _What to change:_ In `shard_load_balancer.hpp`, modify `select_shard_p2c()` candidate generation to exclude shard 0: change `std::uniform_int_distribution<uint32_t> dist(0, _shard_count - 1)` to `dist(1, _shard_count - 1)`. Alternatively, add a configurable `_excluded_shards` set for flexibility. Also update `select_shard_async()` candidate generation to match.
  _Location:_ `src/shard_load_balancer.hpp` (lines 114, 164-169)
  _Complexity:_ Low
  _Priority:_ P2 — Deferred until cross-shard dispatch ships

### 23.2 Hard Shard 0 Isolation (Future — Evidence-Gated)

- [ ] **If shard 0 reactor utilization consistently exceeds 80% while other shards are below 50%, isolate shard 0 from data plane entirely**
  _Justification:_ In large clusters (8+ nodes, 20+ backends), control plane work becomes non-trivial: gossip protocol traffic scales with cluster size, health probes scale with backend count, K8s watch reconnects can spike during topology changes. If shard 0 becomes a bottleneck, full isolation prevents cascading degradation.
  _Evidence trigger:_ Monitor `seastar_reactor_utilization` on shard 0 vs other shards under production load. Only proceed if sustained asymmetry is observed.
  _What to change:_ In `application.cpp:697-699`, conditionally skip data plane route registration on shard 0. Keep `/health` endpoint accessible on shard 0 (or move to all shards). May require Seastar `SO_INCOMING_CPU` tuning to prevent OS from dispatching TCP connections to shard 0.
  _Location:_ `src/application.cpp` (lines 697-699), `src/http_controller.cpp` (route registration)
  _Complexity:_ Medium
  _Priority:_ P3 — Only if evidence warrants; premature on clusters <8 nodes or <16 cores
  _Tradeoff:_ Permanently loses 1/N data plane capacity (25% on 4-core, 12% on 8-core, 6% on 16-core). Shard 0 would be mostly idle between control plane bursts — wasted core on small deployments.
